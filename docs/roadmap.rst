Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


Before starting implementation
==============================

* Basic requirements analysis: :doc:`usecases`, :doc:`requirements-analysis`

  * involve different stakeholders

* Stable functional overall system architecture: :doc:`architecture`


For version 0.1
===============

* Data model for user-facing dataset and eveH5 file components

  * data model for measurement and setup (both from SCML file) may come later

* basic interface for packages operating on data

  * packages: evedataviewer, radiometry

* import of most current eveH5 files, covering the entire information available
