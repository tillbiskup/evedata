}
SCML *-- Scan
SCML *-- Setup
SCML *-- "n" Plugin

note right of SCML::author
    The author attribute is not present in the
    SCML file, but in the HDF5 layer of an
    eveH5 file.

    Nevertheless, it seems sensible to put it
    in here, as evefile has an attribute "scml"
    containing an object of this class.
