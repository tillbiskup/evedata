Who is the target audience of the evedata package? Is it interesting for me?


Synchrotron radiometry people at PTB Berlin
===========================================

The evedata package currently primarily addresses **radiometry** people working at the synchrotron beamlines at BESSY-II and MLS in Berlin operated by the German National Metrology Institute, the `Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) <https://www.ptb.de/>`_. If you are looking for a **data viewer tool**, aimed at conveniently inspecting data directly at the beamline, you may have a look at the ``evedataviewer`` package. And if you are interested in the **reproducible processing and analysis** of radiometry data, have a look at the ``radiometry`` package.
