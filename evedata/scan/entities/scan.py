*Entities representing a scan performed by the eve engine.*

Scans are defined in XML files using a schema called Scan Markup Language
(SCML). While these scan descriptions can be conveniently be modified using
the eve GUI, eventually the eve engine receives an SCML file with a scan
description that it executes.

The idea behind this module and the entire :mod:`scan <evedata.scan>`
subpackage is *not* to really parse the SCML file and provide means to
modify the scan description, but rather to represent those aspects important
for interpreting the resulting eveH5 files, besides all the relevant
metadata for the individual devices used.

An SCML file usually contains a scan block defining the actual scan, and the
entities of such a scan is what this module is concerned with. Other parts
of the SCML file are a setup part (not yet a block, as of SCML schema v9.2)
containing the description of the devices (detectors, motors, devices)
explicitly used in the scan, and a plugins section.


Overview
========

A first overview of the classes implemented in this module and their
hierarchy is given in the UML diagram below, :numref:`Fig. %s
<fig-uml_evedata-scan.scan_current_api>`.


.. _fig-uml_evedata-scan.scan_current_api:

.. figure:: /uml/evedata.scan.entities.scan_current.*
    :align: center
    :width: 750px

    Class hierarchy of the :mod:`scan.entities.scan
    <evedata.scan.entities.scan>` module, somewhat resembling the schema of
    the SCML file, but modified in light of implementing the classes
    contained in the module. As the scan module is already quite complicated,
    event and plot-related classes have been separated into their own
    modules. Hint: For a larger view, you may open the image in a separate
    tab. As it is vectorised (SVG), it scales well.


.. important::

    Note that for the time being, only a subset of the classes shown in the
    above UML diagram is implemented, and only the most relevant attributes
    of these classes.


As a comparison, shown below in :numref:`Fig. %s
<fig-uml_evedata-scan.scan_api>` is an UML diagram more closely resembling
the current state of affairs in the SCML schema (version 9.2).

    An appended scan module is executed once the current scan module is
    finished, while nested scan modules are executed for each position of
    the current scan module.


    Attributes
    ----------
    id : :class:`int`
        Unique ID of the scan module.

        The IDs are numeric and start with 1, as the root node is always 0.
        Hence, the first scan module defined will have 0 as its parent.

    name : :class:`str`
        Name of the scan module.

        The scan module appears in the graphical representation eve GUI with
        this name. Hence, providing good names can be very valuable.

    parent : :class:`id`
        Unique ID of the parent scan module.

        In case of the first scan module, this is 0.

    nested : :class:`int`
        Unique ID of the nested scan module.

        A scan module can have 0..1 appended and 0..1 nested scan modules.

        Default: None

    is_nested : :class:`bool`
        Whether the scan module itself is nested.

        A scan module can either be appended or nested. Given that the
        scan modules are unaware of the other scan modules and (currently)
        only contain IDs as references to their parent and appended or
        nested scan module, this information needs to be set from outside,

        Number of positions created during the scan module.

        Positions are the fundamental quantisation of the data in eveH5
        files. Each position axes are moved to is assigned a "position
        count", *i.e.* a unique integer value. Furthermore, positionings
        of axes at the end of the scan module (in the "positioning phase")
        get their own position number.

        For snapshot modules, things are quite simple: Each snapshot
        module creates its own position, one per module.

    number_of_positions_per_pass : :class:`int`
        Number of positions created during *one pass* of the scan module.

        Scan modules can be nested, and even though a given scan module
        is not nested itself, it can be in a chain of scan modules that
        are nested. Hence, the total number of positions created during a

        Unique ID of the nested scan module.

        A scan module can have 0..1 appended and 0..1 nested scan modules.

        Default: None

    is_nested : :class:`bool`
        Whether the scan module itself is nested.

        A scan module can either be appended or nested. Given that the
        scan modules are unaware of the other scan modules and (currently)
        only contain IDs as references to their parent and appended or

        Default: False

    number_of_positions : :class:`int`
        Number of positions created during the scan module.

        Positions are the fundamental quantisation of the data in eveH5
        files. Each position axes are moved to is assigned a "position
        count", *i.e.* a unique integer value. Furthermore, positionings
        of axes at the end of the scan module (in the "positioning phase")
        get their own position number.

        module creates its own position, one per module.

        Default: 1

    number_of_positions_per_pass : :class:`int`
        Number of positions created during *one pass* of the scan module.

        Scan modules can be nested, and even though a given scan module
        is not nested itself, it can be in a chain of scan modules that
        are nested. Hence, the total number of positions created during a
        scan for a given scan module can be different from the number of
        positions during a single pass.

        Default: 1

    positions : :class:`list` | :class:`numpy.array`
        Actual positions created during the scan module.

        These positions cannot necessarily be inferred from the definition
        of the scan module itself, but sometimes only be obtained from the
        actual measurement.

    axes : :class:`dict`
        Motor axes actively being used in the scan module.

        The keys are the unique IDs (UID) of the axis, while the values are
        :obj:`Axis` objects. This allows for easy access of a given axis
        given its UID.

    channels : :class:`dict`
        Detector channels actively being used in the scan module.

        The keys are the unique IDs (UID) of the channel, while the values are

    perform setup scans in scan modules that are prepended to the scan
    modules performing the actual measurement, and have both, setup and
    actual measurement in one scan.

    A positioning gets its separate position (count) in the eveH5 file,

    """
    Steps defined by reference to another axis.

    Allows to set the actual axis position by reference to another axis.

    .. note::

        Currently (version 2.1), the eve engine accepts only to reference
        axes from the same scan module, meaning that the axis has the same
        number of positions as the reference axis.

        The intended behaviour for referencing axes *outside* the current
        scan module is currently ill-defined. Despite the error displayed,
        the engine saves "0" as position(s) to the respective axis,
        with as many positions as total positions in the respective scan
        module.


    Attributes
    ----------
    mode : :class:`str`
        How to interpret the positions.

        Possible values are ``add`` and ``multiply``.

        In case of ``add``, positions are used as absolute positions or
        summand for the initial position at the start of the scan module,
        depending on how :attr:`Axis.position_mode` is set.

        Default: ``add``

    parameter : :class:`float`
        Summand or factor used to calculate the position given the reference.

    axis_id : :class:`str`
        Unique ID of the axis used as reference.

    scan_module : :class:`ScanModule`
        Reference to the scan module the axis is defined in.

        To calculate the positions, we need to check whether the reference
        axis given by :attr:`axis_id` is in the current scan module.


    Examples
    --------
    The :class:`StepReference` class is not meant to be used directly, as any
    entities, but rather indirectly by means of the respective facades in
    the boundaries technical layer of the :mod:`evedata.scan` subpackage.

    this class. Of course, you can instantiate an object as usual.
