*Metadata classes corresponding to the data entities.*

Data without context (*i.e.* metadata) are mostly useless. Hence, to every
class (type) of data in the :mod:`evedata.evefile.entities.data` module,
there exists a corresponding metadata class in this module.


Overview
========

A first overview of the classes implemented in this module and their
hierarchy is given in the UML diagram below.

.. figure:: /uml/evedata.evefile.metadata.*
    :align: center
    :width: 750px

    Class hierarchy of the :mod:`evedata.evefile.entities.metadata` module.
    Each concrete class in the :mod:`evedata.evefile.entities.data` module
    has a corresponding metadata class in this module.
    You may click on the image for a larger view.


A note on the :class:`AbstractDeviceMetadata` interface class: The eveH5
dataset corresponding to the :class:`TimestampMetadata` class is special in
sense of having no PV and transport type nor an id. Several options have been
considered to address this problem:

#. Moving these three attributes down the line and copying them multiple
   times (feels bad).
#. Leaving the attributes blank for the "special" dataset (feels bad, too).
#. Introduce another class in the hierarchy, breaking the parallel to the
   Data class hierarchy (potentially confusing).
#. Create a mixin class (abstract interface) with the three attributes and
   use multiple inheritance/implements.

As obvious from the UML diagram, the last option has been chosen. The name
"DeviceMetadata" resembles the hierarchy in the ``scml.setup`` module and
clearly distinguishes actual devices from datasets not containing data
read from some instrument.


The following is not a strict inheritance hierarchy, but rather a grouped
hierarchical list of classes for quick access to their individual API
documentation:

  * :class:`MeasureMetadata`

class Metadata:
    """
    Metadata for the devices involved in a measurement.

    This is the base class for all data(sets) and not meant to be used
    directly. Rather, one of the individual subclasses should actually be
    used.

    This class complements the class
    :class:`evedata.evefile.entities.data.Data`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : :class:`str`
        Name of the device.

        Devices are uniquely identified by an ID that usually corresponds
        to the EPICS process variable (PV). However, most devices have
        "given" names as well that provide a more human-readable alternative.

    options : :class:`dict`
        (Scalar) options of the device.

        Devices can have options. Generally, there are two types of
        options: those whose values are *not* changing within a given scan
        module, and those whose values can potentially change for every
        individual position (count). The former are stored here as
        key--value pairs with the key corresponding to the option name.
        The latter are stored in the
        :attr:`evedata.evefile.entities.data.Data.options` attribute.

    Examples
    --------
    The :class:`Metadata` class is not meant to be used directly, as any
    entities, but rather indirectly by means of the respective facades in
    the boundaries technical layer of the :mod:`evedata.evefile` subpackage.
    Hence, for the time being, there are no dedicated examples how to use
    this class. Of course, you can instantiate an object as usual.

    Examples
    --------
    The :class:`SampleCameraMetadata` class is not meant
    to be used directly, as any entities, but rather indirectly by means
    of the respective facades in the boundaries technical layer of the
    :mod:`evedata.evefile` subpackage. Hence, for the time being,
    there are no dedicated examples how to use this class. Of course,
    you can instantiate an object as usual.

class SkipMetadata(AverageChannelMetadata):
    """
    Metadata for skip detector channel.

    This class complements the class
    :class:`evedata.evefile.entities.data.SkipData`. See there for further
    details. Note that in this particular case, the class hierarchy of the
    data and metadata classes is not parallel, as this class inherits from
    :class:`AverageChannelMetadata`. This is due to the skip detector
    channel being close to an average detector channel regarding its
    metadata, but not its actual data.


    Attributes
    ----------
    n_averages : :class:`int`
        Number of averages

    low_limit : :class:`float`
        Minimum value for first reading of the channel

        If set, the value of the channel defined in :attr:`channel` is
        read and needs to be larger than this minimum value to start the
        comparison phase.

    max_attempts : :class:`float`
        Maximum number of attempts for reading the channel data.

        In case of an MPSKIP EPICS channel, this value is not contained in
        the channel itself, but set by a counter motor axis in the same
        scan module. Hence, the value can only be obtained from the SCML.

    max_deviation : :class:`float`
        Maximum deviation allowed between two values in the comparison phase.

        If the :attr:`low_limit` is set, as soon as the value of the
        channel defined in :attr:`channel` is larger than the low limit, the
        comparison phase starts. Here, two subsequent channel readouts
        need to be within the boundary set by :attr:`max_deviation`.

        However, no more than :attr:`max_attempts` channel readouts are done.

    channel : :class:`str`
        EPICS PV of the channel whose values are read and used.
