*Changing (preprocessing) data during import.*

Data as read from an HDF5 dataset often need to be processed in some way.
Due to the intrinsic strategy of the evedata package to load data only
*on demand*, this cannot simply be done during mapping, but needs to be
hooked in to the :class:`DataImporter
<evedata.evefile.entities.data.DataImporter>` class. Hence, all the
preprocessing steps implemented here inherit from
:class:`ImporterPreprocessingStep
<evedata.evefile.entities.data.ImporterPreprocessingStep>`.

Note that in this module, only the (more) generic preprocessing steps are
implemented. More specific preprocessing steps may be implemented in other
modules of the :mod:`controllers <evedata.evefile.controllers>` subpackage as
well. One example is the :mod:`mpskip <evedata.evefile.controllers.mpskip>`
module.


Overview
========

The following preprocessing steps have been implemented so far:

* :class:`SelectPositions`

  Extract rows of data corresponding to a list of positions.

    Extract rows of data corresponding to a list of positions.

    When splitting datasets, only part of the data contained in an HDF5
    dataset need to be retained. Typically, extracting the correct rows
    relies on a list of known positions.

    This preprocessing step returns those rows whose values in the first
    column correspond to the values provided as :attr:`positions`


    Attributes
    ----------
    positions : :class:`list` | :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        Positions of the dataset to be selected.

        These positions are interpreted as values in the first column of the
        corresponding HDF5 dataset. Typically, this is the "position count".


    Examples
    --------
    Selecting positions from a given dataset requires a list or array of
    positions, and of course the corresponding data:

    .. code-block::

        task = SelectPositions()
        task.positions = [2, 4, 5]
        result = task.process(data)

    The selected data are returned by :meth:`process`, as shown above.
