*Importing eveH5 data from synchrotron radiometry measurements conducted at BESSY/MLS in Berlin.*

Welcome! This is evedata, a Python package for a Python package for **importing (synchrotron) radiometry data** obtained at one of the beamlines at **BESSY-II or MLS in Berlin**, mostly operated by the German National Metrology Institute, the `Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) <https://www.ptb.de/>`_. This package acts as main interface between the (eveH5) data files and the processing and analysis code and provides abstractions that allow for a convenient and intuitive access to the data and information contained in the data files. For related packages for viewing and analysing those data, have a look at the "related projects" section below.


Features
========

A list of (planned) features:

* Importer for eve HDF5 files (used at PTB in Berlin, Germany)

* Fully backwards-compatible to older eveH5 versions

* Complete information available that is contained in an eveH5 file

* Powerful and intuitive abstractions, allowing for associative access to data and information


And to make it even more convenient for users and future-proof:

* Open source project written in Python (>= 3.9)

* Developed fully test-driven

* Extensive user and API documentation


Installation
============

To install the evedata package on your computer (sensibly within a Python virtual environment), open a terminal (activate your virtual environment), and type in the following::

    pip install evedata


Related projects
================

There is a number of related packages users of the evedata package may well be interested in, as they have a similar scope, focussing on working with synchrotron radiometry data.

* radiometry

  A Python package for **processing and analysing (synchrotron) radiometry data** in a **reproducible** and mostly **automated** fashion. Currently, it focusses on data obtained at one of the beamlines at **BESSY-II or MLS in Berlin**, mostly operated by the German National Metrology Institute, the `Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) <https://www.ptb.de/>`_.

* evedataviewer

  A Python package for **graphically inspecting data** contained in EVE files, *i.e.* data **obtained at one of the beamlines at BESSY-II or MLS in Berlin**, mostly operated by the German National Metrology Institute, the `Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) <https://www.ptb.de/>`_.
